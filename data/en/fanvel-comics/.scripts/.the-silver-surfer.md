# 2. The Silver Surfer

Re-introduction of the Fantastic 4, but this time, from the perspective of the Silver Surfer, who regains their memories on the events of the story. 

The Silver Surfer, in tandem with the Fantastic 4, manage to defeat and kill galactus, de-estabalizing their universe. This causes the Kang Echo to start appearing in this universe, the first to introduce this marking.

The Silver Surfer becomes the Eternal Entity of Soul here.
