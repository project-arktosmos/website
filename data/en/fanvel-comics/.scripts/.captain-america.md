# 5. Untitled Captain America Project

We revisit the themes set up on Falcon & Winter Soldier, as well as Captain America: Brave New World.

Sam is acting as Captain America, and doubts his missions post-blip when talking with Bucky, who acts as the narrator.

We see Sam face off against the president, Red Hulk, and the CIA director, Valentina.

Sam will learn a deepstate op to basically empover and make ill the re-blipped tricky populations, with test cases in third world countries, and that's to be soon implemented in the US.

Sam assembles his New Avengers for this, along with:
- Bucky
- War Machine
- She-Hulk
- Daredevil

This mixes in the "The Hulks" project with the captain america one, leaving a single storyline in which the New Avengers assemble
