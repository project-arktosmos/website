# 8. X-Men: Incursion

All the time fiddling catches up with their reality, which gets the Echo of Kang early on.

The movie resolves arround a collapsing universe, which eventually just leaves Jean Grey living, with all their most powerful mutants being taken one by one.

She manages to bring a few of the X-Men onto the final fight, with her Phoenix powers combined.
