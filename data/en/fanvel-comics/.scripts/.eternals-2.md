# 4. Eternals II

The fleeting eternals learn about Thanos' plan through his brother, and revive the Mad Titan to learn more about it.

Thanos explains the lack of inteligent life was meant to weaken the breeding Celestials, and die peacefully, but the Avengers fucked it up.

A fight between him and the Eternals breaks out, which ends up in peace, as they all are kindof on the same boat here.

It is revealed that the Celestials pre-date this universe, and are therefore outside the scope of the power of the Infinity Stones. With his "easy" plan being blown up, Thanos proceeds to take on the original plan, and manually murder the rest of Celestials.

The Eternals struggle, but eventually join in on his cause, arguing that releasing the rest of Eternals, and keeping the living planets alive, is a good ultimate goal.

They partner up with Thanos to travel up to where their known Celestial hangs out. In there, the Celestial blows up most of the Eternals, leaving just Thanos and another one spared, so that they remember, and become guardians, of the Celestial realm, with the warning of how futile the best of their efforts against them even is.
