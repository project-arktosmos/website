# Fanvel Comics

The MCU has been telling not-so-great stories for a while. Fanvel Comics aims to use the existing MCU footage to create a proper multiversal arc.

## Canon Atlas
Everything up to Avengers: Endgame is canonical in Fanvel Comics, and stories start to drift off from there. Some will be mostly kept as the movies, such as Eternals or Shang-Chi, while others will see full reworks, or ditches.

### Captain Marvel II: The Annihilator
This 32-page one-shot establishes the Fanvel Multiversal saga by rewriting the MCU film "The Marvels" into a sequel to Captain Marvel's first movie.

Establishes Monica as either Kang, or the Eternal Entity of Time

### Scarlett Witch & The Vision
Duo film mostly rewriting Wandavision, with Agatha being a major character.

Wanda is established as the Eternal Entity of Reality

### Young Avengers
Kate Bishop, Kamala Kang and America Chavez team up against a NY-level threat, TBD.

Shang-Chi and Suri will join the young avengers throughout the story

Shang-Chi becomes the Eternal Entity of Power.

### The Hulks
Buddy-adventure of Professor Hulk and She-Hulk, featuring Daredevil as her boyfriend. Red Hulk might show up


### Captain America: Brave New World
Proper rewrite of both Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and Brave New World, which properly centers the narrative around racism, using Bucky as the supportive white man in the story, and establishing a proper romance between him and Sam.

### Thunderbolts
Full-on rewrite of the Thunderbolts movie, similar to Captain Marvel II. TBD

Bob becomes the Eternal Entity of the Soul.

### X-Men: Incursion
The X-Men, using footage from all the available FOX-era films, see their universe collapse under a multiversal threat

Introduces Jean Grey as the Eternal Entity of the Mind


### Spider Wars
Using footage from all the available Spider-Man films, assemble a multiversal spider-man story in which a Spider-Man ascends to see the multiversal web connecting all spider-present realities, and uses it to assemble a formidable team of sinister six. the mainline spidermen follow up their picked up sinister sixes, and must defeat them as the dark spiderman tries to achieve their plans with the sinister six. could introduce madame web, and the spidergirls, as part of this plot line. 

This should lead to the big crossover event directly, setting up Madame Web as a champion, trying to use the sinister six to take on Kang, and being left with the 6 spider-peoples



### Kang Dynasty
The big crossover event, a true avengers-level threat. The recast Kang, probably Monica, or maybe Loki, are left at the end of time, where the spiderpeople arrive. Kang has carefully gathered her champions to fight off the threat, but doesn't know the counter-Kang has used this to also gather here the entities.

There, Kang is trying to contain a threat. The counter-Kang, probably Loki or Doctor Strange, reveals their plan to gather the six Eternal Entities on the sacred timeline from all across the multiverse, and offer to use their power to alter reality, and remove the threat altogether

Each hero must act in character, siding with either Kang or Counter-Kang, to either use the entities to remove the threat, altering reality beyond recognition, with unknown consequences, or take on the threat, letting Kang open up the gates at the end of the universe, and face whatever is on the other side before it can take on reality.

The fight is interrupted as the doors crumble, and the threat reveals itself.

What it actually is? Go fucking figure
